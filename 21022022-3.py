"""
The class has been told about the following loop commands today:

Break: completely exits your loop at the point you set

Continue: goes back to the beginning of your loop at the point you set

Pass: Tells python that there is code rather than nothing

Exercise: Continue, Break, Pass commands:

    -Create a list with at least 15 random entries

    -Iterate over it with a for loop and add up the elements

    -Create one if statement in your loop that canâ€™t be true and
    add a pass

    -Include a second if statement in your loop that breaks the
    loop if your sum gets bigger than a threshold ( you chose)

    -Include a third if statement in your loop that uses continue if
    the current entry of your list is in a specific range, eg. 50 to
    60, and prints out something in all other cases (use else)

    -Print out the sum and the number of
