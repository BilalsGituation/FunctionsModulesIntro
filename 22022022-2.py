Exercise 37 â€“ Random generator
Write a program that generates several random numbers.

Let the user input the ranges for three random integers.

Let the user choose how many random floats between 0 and 1 should be created.
Let the user put in at least two mu and two sigma to create normaldistribution values.

What happens if you switch these two values?

Last but not least put all
generated values in a list, print the list, shuffle the list and print it again
